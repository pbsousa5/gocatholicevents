	Go Catholic Events is an open source project that seeks to bring
	together all of the Catholic events from different parishes into one
	place. While we can only be as accurate as the parish sites we glean
	the information from, we strive to always be as up-to-date as they are.
	The best way to contribute is by sending us a <a
		href="https://github.com/salutarismedia/gocatholicevents"
		target="_blank">GitHub</a> pull request. Not into computers? Help out
	by spreading the word about our little project, or suggesting some new
	features you think would help on the <a
		href="https://github.com/salutarismedia/gocatholicevents/issues"
		target="_blank">issue tracker</a>. Thanks for reading and God love
	you!
